# RhombixTechnologies_Tasks

This repository contains the projects assigned to me during my Cloud Computing Internship at Rhombix Technologies. Throughout this internship, I worked on various cloud-related projects, gaining hands-on experience with technologies like AWS, Apache2, MySQL, PHP, and more.

## Internship Overview

During my internship at Rhombix Technologies, I was tasked with implementing cloud-based solutions, managing cloud infrastructure, and deploying applications. The projects involved working with both front-end and back-end technologies, setting up databases, configuring cloud services, and ensuring the scalability and security of the systems.

### Key Technologies and Tools Used:
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: For hosting and managing cloud-based applications and services.
- **Apache2**: Web server used for hosting the projects.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for managing project data.
- **PHP**: Scripting language used for developing server-side logic.
- **GitHub**: Version control system for code management and collaboration.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for front-end development of web applications.

The internship allowed me to improve my skills in cloud computing, DevOps, application deployment, and cloud-based system design. The following projects were part of my learning and development during this internship.

## Projects

- **Cloud Photo Gallery**: A cloud-based application for managing and displaying images stored on AWS S3.
- **Online Blood Banking System**: A system for managing blood donations and requests with an admin portal for approval.

These projects helped me learn how to integrate cloud services, deploy applications to EC2 instances, set up MySQL databases, and ensure the security and efficiency of the deployed systems.
